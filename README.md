# README.MD

I decided to write my own Facebook messenger bot when I saw the [CNN's](http://digiday.com/publishers/one-month-cnn-learned-facebook-messenger-bots/) bot and was like, I need that in my life.

Facebook has pretty detailed [instructions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/text-message), but I chose to follow Hartley Brody's wonderful step-by-step [guide](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/fb-messenger-bot/) for the basic set-up.

I've also added a few things of my own. Typing 'nytimes' will fetch you the most popular stories from - you guessed it - the [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/), while typing 'dog' will show you a random image of a silly pup.
